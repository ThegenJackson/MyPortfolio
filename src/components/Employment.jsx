            As a Level 2 Service Desk Technician I provide support for other Service Desk Technicians, deliver
            training and act as a point of escalation. My core focus involves supporting Azure infrastructure,

            My role involves utilizing various Azure and Microsoft 365 Admin Services including Entra ID,
            Conditional Access Policies, Defender, Exchange, Teams and SharePoint. My shift from Application
            Support to an MSP Service Desk was motivated by a desire to widen my scope of knowledge through
            hands-on involvement across all domains of IT, with a focus on Networking, Security and Cloud.

            The STREAMS application suite I supported consists primarily of C# .NET desktop applications,

            Since InspHire adopted Confluence and JIRA in 2022 I was closely involved in a large effort to
            strengthen ITSM practices inline with ITIL4 through creating standardized documentation templates,
            optimizing Knowledge Management, and assisted redesigning several Standard Operating Procedures.
